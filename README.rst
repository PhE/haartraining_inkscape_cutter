What is it

subjects from many images.
If you have thousands of subjects in a single photo (for cells counting in
biology for example), the task can be painfull.
Using a tool like Inkscape for selecting the positive/negatives cases in a
single photo is more friendly.

Main features
---------------

* Draw rectangles in Inkscape to define positive subjects
* Draw rectangles in Inkscape to define negative subjects
* Use different layers
* Run a single script to produce the positive.dat
* Simple workflow : edit in inkscape, run a script
